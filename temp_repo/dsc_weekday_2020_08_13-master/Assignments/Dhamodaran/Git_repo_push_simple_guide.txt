Git Push - Summary of Steps:
============================

Open Git Bash command line console (for Windows)

Goto directory where you want to clone the remote repository
(ex. cd d/learnbay/)

$ git clone https://github.com/leangaurav/dsc_weekday_2020_08_13
Cloning into 'dsc_weekday_2020_08_13'...
...
Note: 
The clone dir is created (ex. cd d/learnbay/dsc_weekday_2020_08_13)

$ git status
On branch master
...


Now create a local directory inside in your name.
Ex. "d/learnbay/dsc_weekday_2020_08_13/Assignments/YourName/"
Then move to the Assignments/ dir.
Ex. $ cd d/learnbay/dsc_weekday_2020_08_13/Assignments/


$ git add YourName/
warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in Assignments/YourName/.... 
Note: 
ignore this warning


$ git status
...
	new file:   YourName/xxxxxxxxxxxxx.ipynb
...
Note: The new file added reflects in status


$ git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"


$ git commit -m "Your meaningful comment"


$ git remote add origin https://github.com/leangaurav/dsc_weekday_2020_08_13
fatal: remote origin already exists.
Note: we already pointing to the correct remote url


$ git push origin master
Enumerating objects: 7, done.
Counting objects: 100% (7/7), done.
